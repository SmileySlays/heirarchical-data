# Project Title

Hierarchical Data/Dropbox Admin Functionality

## Description

Basic use of django-mptt to show how you can add models to other models of the same type to form child/parent relationships. Makes database hierarchy easier to interact with. Admin panel allows you to drag models to any level of the hierarchy and changes that model's relationship with the other models depending on placement.

## Getting Started

Source the virtual environment, run "python manage.py runserver", and then head to /files or /admin to view contents. Can create your own superuser in the terminal or use the superuser already created.
